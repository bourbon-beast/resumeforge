  "summary": "Calm under pressure, leaving ego behind enables me to ask the \"small\" and \"simple\" questions that ensure each project goes well with no assumptions. That coupled with trusting my intuition (probably just experience but does not sound as cool) around possible risks and issues that may arise has seen me more often than not deliver to expectations (or beyond) by making clear informed decisions to deliver the best outcomes for my clients and my business. I have accumulated over 2 decades experience running projects, client accounts and building delivery teams across a variety of industries, this experience has also enabled the taking on internal facing roles to drive operations of a business as well as project management for the delivery of high value outcomes.",
