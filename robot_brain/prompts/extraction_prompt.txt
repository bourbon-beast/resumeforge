{
  "basic_info": {
    "company": "Company Name",
    "job_title": "Role Title",
    "location": "Location if specified",
    "experience_level": "Junior/Mid/Senior/Executive",

      "context": "surrounding sentence/paragraph for context",
      "category": "leadership|communication|work_approach|culture|technical_leadership"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Extract signals even if they seem minor - better to over-capture than miss
- Include the actual text/phrases found, don't paraphrase
- Provide enough context to understand what they're looking for
- If no clear personality signals exist, return empty array for personality_signals
- Focus on what the person should BE like, not just what they should DO
