Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my sincere interest in the Senior Product Manager-B2B SaaS position at your company. As an outcomes-focused leader with extensive experience in the design and execution of B2B SaaS platforms in the HR tech landscape, I am confident in my ability to significantly contribute to your team. The values of innovation, empowerment, and global impact that your company espouses strongly resonate with my professional ethos.

In my current role as Chief Product Officer at Outstaffer.com, I have led my team through a significant transformation, taking an early-stage product to market readiness. This included introducing a lightweight product discovery methodology that effectively aligns customer problems with UX design and engineering execution. This track record of success is supported by the ability to maintain a clear outcomes-first approach while balancing user simplicity and the inherent complexities of global employment compliance.

In addition to my expertise in product management, I bring a deep understanding of global employment and compliance tech. At Certane, I held the role of General Manager Technology wherein I was responsible for the organization’s policies, strategic direction, systems, and infrastructure. In this position, I successfully negotiated and managed the transition to an outsourced model for Information Security and Information Systems support. 

As a product leader, I’m adept at translating customer insights and product analytics into practical strategies for development. At the heart of my approach is a commitment to iterative improvement that drives both engagement and adoption. My strong foundation in agile methodologies combined with my experience in scaling products from MVP to market-ready has consistently allowed me to deliver high-value outcomes to my clients.

Furthermore, my background in HR tech and fintech, coupled with over 5 years of managing B2B SaaS platforms, aligns perfectly with the requirements of your job description. My experience in managing cross-functional teams that span product and engineering helps me foster a culture of clarity, iteration, and user-centric focus. Combined with a strong technical background, I am confident in my ability to lead your teams to new heights and drive product innovation in your business.

Your commitment to a remote-first culture, an empowered team, and your reputation for innovation in HR tech excites me. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity of delivering impact on a global scale and believe that my passion for creating user-focused, regulatory-compliant software solutions would make a significant contribution to your company.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss my suitability for this role at your convenience.

Kind regards,
Steven Waters
